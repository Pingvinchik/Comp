====== REST ======
Created Четверг 06 Апрель 2017

Whereas SOAP typically focused on actions and processing, REST ’s concern is with the data being handled.

Certainly, SOAP can be overkill for many applications, and REST brings a simpler alternative. 
Moreover, many modern applications have mobile and rich JavaScript clients that consume REST API s running on a server.

A mistake that’s often made when approaching REST is to think of it as “web services with URL s”—to think of REST as another remote procedure call ( RPC ) mechanism, like SOAP , but invoked through plain HTTP URL s and without SOAP ’s hefty XML namespaces.
On the contrary, REST has little to do with RPC . Whereas RPC is service oriented and focused on actions and verbs, REST is resource oriented, emphasizing the things and nouns that comprise an application

Put more succinctly, REST is about transferring the state of resources—in a representa-
tional form that is most appropriate for the client or server—from a server to a client
(or vice versa).
Resources in REST are identified and located with URL s. There are no strict rules
regarding REST ful URL structure, but the URL should identify a resource, not bark a
command to the server. Again, the focus is on things, not actions.
