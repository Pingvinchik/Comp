**Document:** MongoDB
Document databases aren’t well-tuned for storing data where there’s any significant
degree of relationships. A social network, for example, represents how different
users of an application relate to each other and isn’t best kept in a document data-
base. Even though it’s not impossible to store relation-rich data in a document
database, you’ll find more challenge than benefit in doing so.
