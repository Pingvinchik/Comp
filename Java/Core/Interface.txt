====== Interface ======
Created Воскресенье 11 Июнь 2017

All fields in interface are public static final, i.e. they are constants.

It is generally recommended to avoid such interfaces, but sometimes you can find an interface that has no methods and is used only to contain list of constant values.

An interface defines a contract that some implementation will fulfill for you.

An abstract class provides a default behavior that your implementation can reuse.
