====== Messaging ======
Created Воскресенье 21 Май 2017

Asynchronous messaging is a way of indirectly sending messages from one application to another without waiting for a response.

**JMS**

**WebSocket** is a protocol providing full-duplex communication across a single
socket. It enables, among other things, asynchronous messaging between a web
browser and a server. Being full-duplex means that the server can send messages to
the browser as well as the browser sending messages to the server.
